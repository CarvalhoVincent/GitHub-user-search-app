## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Github API


### What I learned

I learned how to connect an API, and retrieve data from it. How to display a dark mode depends of user preference, how to change a date format using a library. Globally I improved my JavaScript skills, and also responsive layout with Grid and Flexbox properties. 
How to change color of svg.


### Continued development

Grid and Flexbox skills, responsive efficiency, JavaScript, refactoring code ?

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com] - Used it for some reminders about CSS and JS.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Used it for the date format, it helps me cause I was stuck at this point. I found how to use a library, to display the date correctly and look like the asked design.
